3. **Implement data quality rules** - Define specific data quality validation rules
4. **Create reporting dashboards** - Build business intelligence dashboards

### 🔍 Monitoring & Visibility

#### What You Can Monitor
- **API Performance** - Response times, error rates, retry counts
- **Database Performance** - Query times, connection pools, error rates
- **Processing Performance** - Stage timing, memory usage, throughput
- **Data Quality** - Completeness, accuracy, consistency scores
- **Business Metrics** - Revenue, invoice counts, customer activity
- **System Health** - Lambda performance, error rates, resource usage

#### Sample Queries for Monitoring

```sql
-- Get recent executions with errors
SELECT * FROM get_recent_executions_with_errors(24);

-- Get performance trends for last 7 days
SELECT * FROM get_performance_trends(7);

-- Get execution summary for specific run
SELECT * FROM get_execution_summary('your-execution-id');

-- Find slow database queries
SELECT * FROM database_query_log 
WHERE execution_time_ms > 1000 
ORDER BY execution_time_ms DESC;

-- Check data quality issues
SELECT * FROM data_quality_log 
WHERE quality_score < 90 
ORDER BY quality_check_timestamp DESC;
```
